In this post, I‚Äôm documenting my current development workflow‚Äîone that I‚Äôve shaped over time to stay fast, focused, and distraction-free. It‚Äôs a terminal-first setup centered around `tmux`, `Neovim`, and `uv`, optimized specifically for fast prototyping and iterating on GenAI applications in Python.

While IDEs are getting heavier and more AI-assisted every year, I‚Äôve stuck to a lightweight stack that‚Äôs entirely keyboard-driven, reproducible, and persistent across sessions.

## üîß Tools I Rely On

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the tools and plugins that make up my daily environment:

- **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)** ‚Äì Terminal multiplexer for splitting windows, managing panes, and quickly switching between projects.
- **[tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect)** ‚Äì Saves and restores tmux sessions, windows, and panes after a restart.
- **[tpm (Tmux Plugin Manager)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)** ‚Äì Manages my tmux plugins with a simple `prefix + I` keybind to install.
- **[vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator)** ‚Äì Allows seamless navigation between tmux panes and Neovim splits using `<C-h/j/k/l>`.
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** ‚Äì A super-fast Python package manager and runtime built in Rust. It replaces `pip + venv` and drastically reduces Python project startup time.
- **[IPython](https://ipython.org/)** ‚Äì For fast prototyping and testing, IPython inside a uv shell is my go-to REPL.
- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** via [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.org) ‚Äì My IDE setup is based on LazyVim, providing a modern, minimal Neovim config with lazy-loaded plugins and tight performance.

## üß† Why This Setup?

I work primarily with Python in GenAI and LLM-related projects, where iteration speed and reproducibility matter. This setup gives me:

- Instant context switching across panes and projects  
- Persistent development sessions I can resume anytime  
- Blazingly fast Python environment creation and package installs  
- Snappy, customized editing experience in Neovim  
- Seamless navigation between editor and shell  

All of this, without leaving the terminal.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It All Comes Together

Here‚Äôs how I usually structure my workspace:

1. Start a new tmux session for each project:
   ```bash
   tmux new-session -s my-genai-project
   ```
2.	Create tmux windows for:
-	nvim ‚Äì for coding
-	uv venv && ipython ‚Äì for REPL-based prototyping
-	Logs / server output / pytest runs
3.	Use tmux-resurrect to save the session:
  ```bash
  # Save session
  prefix + Ctrl-s

  # Restore session later
  prefix + Ctrl-r
  ```
4.	To move between Neovim and shell panes:
  ```bash
  # Ctrl-h/j/k/l will move across tmux and Neovim splits
  ```
5. Run python in uv
  ```bash
  uv init --no-workspace .
  uv add openai transformers
  uv run ipython
  ```
6.	My entire setup is version-controlled in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/AimAmit/dotfiles) repo, making it portable and repeatable across systems.

### üì¶ Example: Setting Up a New Project
```bash
# Create a new directory and init Python env
mkdir langchain-memory-rag
cd langchain-memory-rag
uv init --no-workspace .
uv add llama-index langchain openai

# Launch REPL
uv run ipython
```

Launch your tmux + Neovim session from here and you‚Äôre set.
